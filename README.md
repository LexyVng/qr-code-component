## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive and accessibility techniques
- Google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)

### What I learned

This challenge encouraged me to conduct further research into the very important topics of accessibility and responsiveness. For example, I replaced px unit with rem unit where necessary and used semantic HTML elements, like `main` and `footer`. In addition, I used a CSS reset by Josh Comeau (https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) to eliminate incosistencies and applied BEM CSS naming convention to make the code easier to read and maintain.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  div.card {
    margin: 5rem auto;
  }
}

img {
  width: 100%;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 1.4rem;
}
```

### Continued development

After completing this challenge, I will continue learning new techniques on how to make websites responsive and accessible, as well as how to write clean code.
