## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive and accessibility techniques
- Google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)

### What I learned

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  div.card {
    margin: 80px auto;
  }
}

img {
  width: 100%;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 1.4rem;
}
```

### Continued development

After completing this challenge, I will continue learning new techniques on how to make websites responsive and accessible, as well as how to write clean code.

### Useful resources

- [Why font-size must NEVER be in pixels](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/font-size-px/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand why using rem instead px results in making more accessible websites and it provides an easy-to-understand way to convert pixels to rem.
